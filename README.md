Vodafone wants to look at the coverage of their cellphone towers in Hamilton, and would like an application that lets them visualise this
information. They have a CSV file of the cellphone towers in Hamilton, one tower per line in the following format: Licensee, Location, Easting,
Northing, Power.

#Here are the first three lines from the file towers.csv:
VODAFONE NZ LTD,HOOD STREET,2711200,6376600,27.4
VODAFONE NZ LTD,WAIKATO HOSPITAL,2711300,6375100,26.5
VODAFONE NZ LTD,RAILWAY STATION HN,2709700,6376500,21.8

The map is the NZMS260 map for Hamilton, and the Northing and Easting values give the position of the tower (how far North and how far East on
the map of NZ). The Power is in kW.
